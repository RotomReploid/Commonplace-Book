            &emsp;&emsp;Oh, it’s over? Well, this was an… interesting project. There were highs, lows, and other vague quality adjectives. It was fun to be able to select what to write about, but nothing is perfect. An issue that was more my fault in how I handled quotes. A more freeform project that is more of just a journal where I write what I want, is come to think of it, not best for school on account of not being as gradable, but I would end up with a lot less scenarios where I have things to say but none relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;My style of writing could have used some work. I more used quotes as an excuse to talk about things, and I did enjoy talking about them, there could have been more actual quote analysis. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;But hey, speaking of quotes, do you know what time it is? Another lightning round! This is where I'll put all the stuff I could’ve talked about if  had a quote to connect it to, and may if I ever continue this book for fun!

            <li>Phonotactics: Phonotactics are the underlying rules of a languages phonology, or the sounds in the language. It’s why “belgiling” sounds more English than “zwagerdelp” sounds closer to English than “rjienrlwey” even though I made two of those words up. You pick the real one. (hint: it’s not English)</li>
            <br />
            <li>Vötgil: This is a conlang (constructed language) whose name is literally “English’nt.” Yep. That’s the intro. There’s a lot to unpack. The phonology and grammar are very Anglocentric, but then it does weird things like having no third person pronouns at all, limiting all words to three letters, having a writing system based on base 4 that’s optimized for communication in Minecraft and having Gil (the English language) be the only proper noun solely so it can call itself “Not English” and I will never get over that.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Lojban: 42.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Loglan: eight most.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Toki Pona: Toki pali ni li musi mute. Enough of that. Toki Pona is a really cool conlang that only has 120-137 words! Each word represents more of a “field” of concepts, like “toki” meaning many things in the “field” of communication: i.e language, speaking, a conversation, or as a greeting. More complex ideas can be made by combining words, for example: ilo (tool) + nanpa (number, calculation) = ilo nanpa (computer). You may realize that there are other things this could represent, but content can fill any gaps. The definitions of words can also display values of the language, for example “pona” means “good” and “simple” because Toki Pona was founded on the principle that simplicity is good. I have way too much to say about Toki Pona, so I’ll stop here. Mi tawa.</li>

        <p>So I guess that’s all for now. It was fun really, but I guess all fun comes to an end. Wait — what? Uh huh, okay. Are you serious?! Well boy, do I owe you one! We just got clearance to continue at leisure! Aw yeah, season 2!</p>
        <hr />
        <p style="text-align:center;">TL;DR: See you later.Oh wait let's do a "end where it starts thing"! So, I guess this is where it <error->strts</error->, huh?</p>
