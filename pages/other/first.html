            &emsp;&emsp;So, I guess this is where it starts, huh? The proposition of a project where I write about what I want twice a week is interesting, and I am excited to see what comes of it. Usually, there is a prompt, or subject to write about, and while there are a few small guidelines, it should be manageable.
<br />
&emsp;&emsp;An issue I may run into is connecting what I want to write with an actual piece of media. I can find random things to write about, but having something to connect them to may become an issue. A simple solution would be to think of something to write about, and then work backward, finding a quote that matches well with it. It’s so easy it feels like cheating. Not enough space? Not a problem! Just start rambling about something completely unrelated!
<br />
&emsp;&emsp;The Handbook of Simplified Spelling is a book proposing English spelling reforms published by the Simplified Spelling Society in 1920. As the name implies, it lists new orthographic (relation between spelling and pronunciation) changes to make English spelling more consistent and readable. While many of the reforms may look <error->bizar</error-> to natives and <error->wil</error-> likely <error->triger yur spelcheck</error->, it is <error->stil</error-> readable and, better yet, it partially achieved its goal. Most American English speakers don’t say <error->gramme</error->, <error->catalogue</error->, or <error->analyse</error->, manoeuver or hiccough, and even doughnut is falling out of fashion. An annoyance, <error->tho</error->, is that many of the other spellings in the book are seemingly disregarded and even actively protested. Spellings like <error->hart</error->, <error->alfabet</error->, <error->retoric</error->, <error->thru</error->, and <error->cof</error-> are considered informal at best. There is no good reason to call these “misspellings”. English doesn’t have a central authority on how the language should be used. We don’t have an Académie française or Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española to tell us how the language is "meant" to be used.
<br />
&emsp;&emsp;An easy way to improve English would be to stop correcting people. Who are you to say “<error->arithmuhtic</error->” has a second a? There is no person that can tell you how to spell. Would it mean that some people may spell words completely different ways? I, suppose, but why is that wrong? English is an anarchist language. It is in the hands of its speakers. We could collectively decide “dog” is spelled “<error->rjienrlwey</error->” and there is no one who could say otherwise. English, and languages as a whole, should be allowed to grow. It’s not about “i before e” or “the first vowel does the talking”, it’s about communicating ideas. All preventing change is going to do is make that harder, especially for non-native speakers. 
<br />
&emsp;&emsp;TL;DR: Welcome! I’ll make all the speling mistakes I wont. Wait, did I make a detour?
