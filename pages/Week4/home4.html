            &emsp;&emsp;Arguing is weird in so many ways. There are right and wrong ways to argue, but most people don’t know exactly what they are. It says nothing about the ideas being argued, yet we treat it like the final say on what ideas are good. You can argue in a way that lets you win the minds of the people while getting everything wrong. People generally know, if any, three or less logical fallacies and how to spot them. Most people don’t study formal debate and rhetorical tactics, so why do we like to argue so much when we don’t know what we’re doing?

            &emsp;&emsp;An easy way to win an argument with a viewing audience is to talk confident and make short, quippy responses like you know what you’re talking about. For bonus points, just tell them what they want to hear and appeal to their biases. It’s the definition of “fake it till you make it,” but people tend to remember the confident, sarcastic guy more than the guy who gave long, boring, maybe even incomprehensible, speeches every five minutes.

            &emsp;&emsp;We take arguments way too seriously for what they are. A debate doesn’t prove the validity of an argument, but rather one side’s ability to argue it and the other side’s ability to refute it. They don’t even need to win, as discussed, but simply display the image of victory. Some debates aren’t even worth having like, “should we genocide [race] of people?” or “is a bird a type of orange?”, but if someone turns down a debate, they’re seen as a weakling who is too scared to defend their beliefs.

            &emsp;&emsp;Arguing is weird in so many ways. Everyone agrees that we should, but no one knows how. One person can have good points, while the other simply needs to bluff, lie, and abuse the phrase “plausible deniability.”

            TL;DR: I’m right, you’re wrong.
