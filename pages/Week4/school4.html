           &emsp;&emsp;All is Lost is a film that follows the day to day events of a man lost at sea. This quote, at face value, exemplifies our protagonist’s apparent helplessness against his conditions. He has resigned to his fate and now is simply waiting out the clock for his inevitable demise. The sheer feeling of inescapable failure that can only be described as, “I am going to die and there is nothing I can do about it.” We see him struggle, but we as an audience as well as the man himself know that hope is gone and nothing will succeed in the end. What’s even the point?

            TL;DR: I’m sad now.
