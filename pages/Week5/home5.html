            &emsp;&emsp;Grammatical gender is a weird thing. Anyone trying to learn French, Spanish, Latin, German, or the like, has probably had the experience of staring at a sentence and thinking, “why is a gardening hose a woman?” Here’s the first mistake: grammatical gender is not the same as… gender gender. Male does not mean “xy chromosome” as much as it means “masculine”, or just “ends in an o”. Another thing to remember is that objects don’t get genders, words do. An example is the masculine word “bolígrafo” in Spanish, meaning “pen”. Compare this to the feminine word “pluma” which means… “pen”. Same with the French “vélo” and “bicyclette”. To wrap around to the Mark Twain quote, the German “Mädchen” falls into the neuter gender because it ends in the diminutive suffix “-chen.” The word is gendered, not the object.

            &emsp;&emsp;Grammatical gender is also useful in language. Since the gender of a word typically modifies the words around it, if you miss a word, you can listen to the other words and find what you missed with gender and surrounding context. Swahili, a more extreme case, if surrounding inflections would put a noun in the group 1/2, you can rule out over 75% of all words in the language! At that point, context can do the rest.
