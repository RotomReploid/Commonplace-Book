            <p>“The sign of our death, the dark and mournful color.'</p>
            <p>She spoke, and fitting the sword-point at her breast,</p>
            <p>Fell forward on the blade, still warm and reeking</p>
            <p>With her lover’s blood.”</p>
            <p>— Ovid, Pyramus and Thisbe</p>

            &emsp;&emsp;Let’s get the record straight: Romeo and Juliet is basically just a ripoff of Pyramus and Thisbe. It makes you wonder, what other cultural cornerstones do we take for granted without actually confirming their originality? Take Oreos, for example. You probably haven’t heard of the original cookies-and-cream snack: Hydrox. The Lion King, classic Disney family film? Ever heard of “Kimba the White Lion?” Beloved mobile game Angry Birds? Ever heard of Crush the Castle? Big Mac? Big Boy’s Double Deck Cheeseburger, predating it by 52 years. Real original, guys.

            TL;DR: You don't need to be original, just more popular.
