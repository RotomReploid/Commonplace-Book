    <h2>Crunch Time!</h2>

            &emsp;&emsp;In [YEAR], game dev Shigeru Miyamoto said "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad." This simple line has a lot to say about not just games, but how we approach deadlines and delays in general, as well as the “crunch” or “grind” mentality we create for ourselves.
<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Crunch culture is a phenomenon where people see it as admirable to sacrifice every other aspect of your life at the altar of work. Unsurprisingly, this is bad. It only gets worse when it gets enforced. Working overtime of your own volition is one thing, but your boss making you work overtime so you can get [CORPORATE PRODUCT] out by Christmas is a whole other thing. It’s what causes buggy games, multi-gigabyte, day-one updates, and DLC that makes you think, “Why wasn’t this here before?”, being added to a game with a shell of a release. No one rushes painters to make more pictures, musicians to make more art, or writers to make more books. 
<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Gaming is an art just like all the rest, but <span title="I suppose, hey!">I suppose</span> it doesn’t count since it’s usually made by a large team and/or published by a large corporation. When people work on a game, they want to see their full creation on display, not an unfinished husk.
