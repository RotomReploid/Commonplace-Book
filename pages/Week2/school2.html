        <p>“Her prayers touched the gods,</p>
        <p>And touched her parents, for the mulberry fruit</p>
        <p>Still reddens at its ripeness, and the ashes</p>
        <p>Rest in a common urn.”</p>
        <p>— Ovid, Pyramus and Thisbe</p>

            &emsp;&emsp;Myths: what are they? Myths are stories often involving gods or personified objects/animals typically told to explain natural phenomena. The first recorded myth is “the Epic of Gilgamesh.” What’s cool about this is that it’s also the first recorded written story. And I mean ANY written story, like, this stuff dates back to 2000 BC. The myth is basically just Gilgamesh and his pal running around having a good time, until the friend dies and Gilgamesh comes to terms with his own mortality. Pretty cool. Back to the quote. This quote in particular, could be considered a myth in the vein of “here’s why this thing is like this.” It links the red of the mulberry plant to the blood of two ill-fated lovers. Beautiful.

            TL;DR: Gilgamesh was the first chad.
