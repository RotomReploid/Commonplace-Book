    <h2>Word Minimums, and Why I Think They’re Dumb</h2>
    <div style="margin:auto;width:45%;">
            &emsp;&emsp;In the play Hamlet, the character Polonius says "Brevity is the soul of wit," when he says that Hamlet is mad. This is a very easy thing to transition into this pages topic, “Word Minimums, and Why I Think They’re Dumb”, or something like that. Word minimums encourage and promote the excessive, unnecessary use of superfluous word excess and stagnative filler. Why encourage people to explain pretty simple ideas in as many words as possible? Articles and newspapers don’t tend to look like high school essays. Writing doesn’t need to have rigid structure and 300+ words to be good.
