            &emsp;&emsp;“Nothing is more dangerous for a new truth than an old misconception.” — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The power of the people exists in places we often don’t think of. There are many silly and serious cases where common “knowledge” and folk superstitions lead to all kinds of shenanigans. To begin on a less serious note, in the 1980s, A&W released a competitor burger to the McDonald’s quarter-pounder that weighed 1/3 pound but for the same price. The burger, however, did not sell well because — get this — people thought the 1/3 burger weighed less. Wait, do you hear that? No, you can’t, but that sound means it’s time for a lightning round! Here we go!
