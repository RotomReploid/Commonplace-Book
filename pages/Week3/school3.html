            &emsp;&emsp;Aw, shoot, now I have to actually be smart. Throughout The Scarlet Ibis, there are many parrallels between the rehabilitated cripple, Doodle, and the sickly scarlet ibis the dies in the middle of the story. Both are seemingly sickly, but go far lengths to become normal. Doodle is trained by his brother to walk, run, and swim, and the scarled ibis struggles across a continent and lands in the yard of a family who is normal in most regards. Although, both’s efforts are in vain with an unceromonius death where they succumb to their own ailments. I can go on, but let’s keep it here.

            TL;DR: It’s hard to make jokes when you’re writing about death due to the ableist pressure to be “normal.”
